# Paper Mario 64 Randomizer Tracker

This is only a tracker for ther randomizer. To patch a legally obtained rom and play the Paper Mario 64 randomizer, you can download it [here](https://pm64randomizer.com/).

If you find any bugs or have any requests for the tracker, you can come in the [Paper Mario 64 Randomizer Discord](https://discord.gg/4Z5G69ZNJg) in the "pmr-tracker" channel and we can talk about it!

## Online tracker

You can user the tracker online [here](https://pm64r-tracker.mryami.com/).

## Installation

This tracker has been developed with Vue3. To install it and run it on your PC, you need to install node.js > 18.18.1 LTS

Then run:

`npm install`

and

`npm run dev`

And for a working production build run:

`npm run build`

Then copy the "images" folder in the new "dist" folder.

## Road map for the tracker

-   Finish the checks for the map tracker;
-   Add the possibility to load a spoiler log and check what is where on the tracker (I have to check the feasibility of it, but that's an idea that I had...);
-   Explore the auto-tracking possibility with BizHawk.
